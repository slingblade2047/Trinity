    // --- Fresh player resolution (character manager) -----------------------
    // The churn-proof alternative to the accessor-discovered stat-entry ring:
    // the gameplay-character manager owns a vector of every live character,
    // and the local player is the single one whose ObjectType is SelfPlayer.
    // Resolving it fresh each tick yields an always-current player with no
    // stale cache - a body transition (mount/transform) reallocates the
    // character, but the next resolve simply returns the new one. See the
    // trinity-engine-architecture notes for the full derivation.
    //
    // The manager is read as `manager = *(*G)` from ~30 sites, each of which
    // then passes it as ARG1 to one of the char-manager API functions.
    //
    // Why the original signature broke, and what replaced it. It keyed on the
    // caller's prologue plus the register the manager was cached into:
    //   mov r14,rdx; mov r12,rcx; mov rax,cs:G; mov r15,[rax]; lea rdi,off_...
    // Every one of those registers is the register allocator's free choice. A
    // game update recompiled that function and duly renamed `mov r15,[rax]` ->
    // `mov rsi,[rax]` and `lea rdi` -> `lea r13`, killing the match while the
    // code's MEANING was untouched.
    //
    // The anchors below instead key only on the bytes between the load and the
    // call - `mov rcx,[rax]` (manager is arg1), the arg2/arg3 setup, and
    // literal struct offsets. Those registers are fixed by the Win64 ABI and
    // the constants are fixed by the struct layout, so none of it is the
    // allocator's to rename. Each anchor is independently unique image-wide and
    // resolves the same global; Install() cross-checks that they agree, so a
    // future update has to break all of them at once to disable the feature,
    // and a single stale survivor cannot quietly win the vote.
    //
    // CAUTION: the same API family is also called with two SIBLING globals
    // (0x61830D0 / 0x61830D8 in the current dump) - the client/server realm
    // split, see the trinity-engine-architecture notes. Do NOT loosen these
    // into "any global passed to the char-manager API": that also matches the

    //
    // WHY the integrator can't be beaten (HW-watchpoint trace of +0xC0,
    // 2026-07-14): the character movement component runs a SERVO. Per tick it
    //   1. computes a drive velocity,
    //   2. passes it as ARG3 into a sub-step driver (IDB sub_2F49550) that
    //      writes it to moveOwner+0xC0 and calls the integrator itself, then
    //   3. measures the displacement that actually happened and books it back
    //      (IDB sub_2F4DE00 writes +0xC0 = (pos_after - pos_before) / dt).
    // Any velocity injected inside the integrator makes the body overshoot
    // what the servo expected and step 3 pulls it right back - pulsing on the
    // flat, hard 1x clamp uphill.
    //
    // THE FIX (live-verified via Frida arg3 scaling: "worked very well, very
    // smooth", including uphill, up to 10x): hook the sub-step driver and
    // scale the HORIZONTAL components of arg3 before the servo consumes it.
    // Vertical stays untouched (gravity rides in arg3 y at ~-55 while
    // grounded; scaling it would slam the character into the ground).
    //
    // MS x64: a1=rcx component, dt=xmm1 f32, arg3=r8 -> f32 x,y,z drive
    // velocity, a4=r9b, a5..a7 stack. The component holds the move-owner
    // (integrator arg1 / hknp proxy) at +0x298 - not needed for gating (this
    // dispatch only runs for the local player in practice, same as
    // kSig_MoveUpdate above; Super Jump ships ungated on the same evidence).
    //
    // GOTCHA (cost a live debug round-trip): arg3 points at a scratch buffer
    // at a very LOW address (~0x013FDD70) - far below kMinPointer. The
    // mem::Read32/Write32 helpers reject anything under that floor, so reading
    // the drive vector through them silently returns false and the scale
    // no-ops (symptom: hook installs and fires, but every component reads 0.00

    //    chain that touches the live slot array).
    //  * The unique instance id is not optional. An earlier design memcpy'd a
    //    template slot and stamped typeId+qty; the item had no id and it BRICKED
    //    A SAVE. Never fabricate a slot - always go through ctor + allocator.
    //  * The REALM must match the target holder (see kTls_RealmFlag): the ctor
    //    reaches sub_ED69660, which reads the client-only storage base
    //    qword_6180EB0 and forces it to 0 in the server realm, so a client-realm
    //    item is subtly different from a server-realm one.
    //  * BOTH holders must be written, each in its own realm, sharing ONE
    //    allocator id - the same rule the quantity editor already follows. The
    //    server->client reconcile syncs quantities but does NOT create slots, so
    //    a server-only add is invisible until a save/reload.
    //
    // Buffer note: the ctor does NOT write every byte of the 192 (+0x0C, +0x3A,

    // The batch blob is 10 blocks x 196 bytes: u16 slotTag (0xFFFF = block

    // home while it is worn. Proven by the equip path (IDB sub_7D7470): when a
    // slot is vacated it PUTS THE OLD ITEM BACK into a bucket
    // (sub_1CE2600 -> sub_F4B8F50, "copy item value into bucket slot, or add
    // to the stack there"), which would duplicate the item if equipping had
    // left it in the bag. The entry carries the item whole - the item-value
    // copy (sub_F4DAD00) copies the dye vector (+0x70/+0x78) with it, which is
    // also why dye survives an unequip.
    //
    // So the durable target is the SERVER realm's equip component, not a
    // holder. sub_7D9C50 renders, and we only ever call it on the client's
    // component; the server's entry is written as plain data with the engine's
    // own upsert primitive (sub_1F8CB40: find record by channel, overwrite,
    // else append via sub_D20110 if count < 12) - no render calls on a server
    // actor. The append can ALLOCATE, so that write runs with the realm flag
    // flipped (kTls_RealmFlag), exactly like the add-item path.
    //
    // (An earlier design searched both holders by instance id and always came
    // up empty - live-confirmed 2026-07-17, every slot: "no client-side item
    // with instance id 1001675". The visual apply was fine; the item was never
    // there to find.)
    //
    // The dyehouse's own server transaction (sub_257C330) addresses items by
    // (storageType, slotIndex) via sub_1CE3CB0 - i.e. it dyes an item sitting
    // in a bucket, then broadcasts the result, which is the ack we call
    // directly. That path is no use to us for worn gear, for the reason above.

    // The equip component of a character: *(*(actor + 0x68) + 0x38). The
